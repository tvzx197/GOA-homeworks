        <p>Just they are people why I love cars so much</p>
        <a>I just love old cars, because they were cars and new cars are just made for money and marketing </a>
        <p>I like cars which doesn't have limits</p>
        <a>For example, not everybody can control e34 </a>
        <p>old cars had souls</p>
